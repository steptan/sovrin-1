        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a DID method specification that conforms to the requirements specified in the DID specification currently
            published by the W3C Credentials Community Group. For more information about DIDs and DID method specifications,
            please see the
            <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-primer.md"

            DIDs on Hitcoin are have several important use cases... Here, we specify how the the Hitcoin Reference (htcr) method for
            managing DIDs on Hitcoin works.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id='sotd'>

        <h2>DID Method Name</h2>
        <p>The namestring that shall identify this DID method is:
            <code class="replace-me">htcr</code>
        </p>
        <p>A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix:
            <code class="replace-me">did:htcr</code>. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after
            the prefix, is the NSI specified below.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Target System(s)</h2>
        <p class="replace-me">Describe the system or systems which are the target of this DID method. The target system may be any DLT or other
            distributed network or other system capable of supporting the CRUD operations. This section should also specify
            any constraints it assumes or imposes on the target system.</p>
        <p class="replace-me">For example: This targets Hitcoin consensus rules exactly equal to the ones in binary X with hash Y. Any time the
            binary changes, the spec will have to be updated accordingly, to clarify how it relates to forks and other evolution.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Namespace Specific Identifier (NSI)</h2>
        <p>The NSI is the uniquely identifying portion of a DID that follows a canonical suffix. Each DID method spec must define
            how their NSIs are composed, parsed, and proved unique.</p>
        <h3>Namestring Generation Method</h3>
        <p class="replace-me">The
            <code>btcr</code> DID method generates NSIs using standard uuid semantics, per
            <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt" target="_blank">RFC 4122</a>.</p>
        <h3>ABNF Definition</h3>
        <pre class="replace-me">
            UUID = time-low "-" time-mid "-"
             time-high-and-version "-"
             clock-seq-and-reserved
             clock-seq-low "-" node
            time-low = 4hexOctet
            time-mid = 2hexOctet
            time-high-and-version = 2hexOctet
            clock-seq-and-reserved = hexOctet
            clock-seq-low = hexOctet
            node = 6hexOctet
            hexOctet = hexDigit hexDigit
            hexDigit =
             "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" /
             "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" /
             "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
        </pre>
        <p class="replace-me">A convenient regex to match
            <code>htcr</code> DIDs is:
            <br/>
            <code>[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}</code>
        </p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p class="replace-me">A valid
            <code>htcr</code> DIDs might be:
            <code>did:htcr:e159f510-aa12-11e7-abc4-cec278b6b50a</code>. Invalid values include capitalized chars, uuids without
            hyphens, uuids with curly braces, etc.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>JSON-LD Context Definition</h2>
        <p class="replace-me">If your method involves storing any state in a DID document for purposes of controlling updates to the DID document,
            you MUST define a JSON-LD context in this section.)</p>
        <p>The official definition of the
            <code>htcr</code> JSON-LD context is:</p>
        <pre class="replace-me json" style="color:magenta">
      {
           "@context":
           {

            evolves... ]]]</p>
        <p class="replace-me">If your JSON-LD context is not versioned exactly through the document versioning mechanism of this spec, define how
            your JSON-LD context will be versioned.</p>

        <h2>CRUD Operation Definitions</h2>

        <h3>Create (Register)</h3>
        <p class="replace-me">The DID method specification must specify how a client creates a DID record—the combination of a DID and its associated
            DDO—on the target system, including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of ownership.</p>
        <p class="replace-me">To create a new DID, you must submit a transaction that looks like this:
            <pre>
                {
                    idenifier: &lt;Trust Anchor DID&gt;, 
                    signature: &lt;signature over this transaction from the Trust Anchor&gt;, 
                    reqId: &lt;a nonce for this transaction&gt;, 
                    operation: {
                        type: NYM, 
                        dest: &lt;new DID that is being registered&gt;, 
                        [verkey: &lt;verification key of the new DID&gt;],
                        [role: &lt; TrustAnchor, TGB, STEWARD or TRUSTEE&gt;]
                    }
                }
            </pre> The transaction must be signed by a Trust Anchor must provide an un-regsitered DID and an optional verification
            key, note that the verkey is optional and can be ommitted at the time of creation and can be added later. If
            the
            <pre>verkey</pre> is ommitted, the Trust Anchor acts as the guarding of the new DID. Possible outcomes from the creation operation
            include:
            <br/> REQNACK: “Malformed transaction or missing required fields”
            <br/> REJECT: “DID already rejistered or non Trust Anchor authored the transaction or signature did not match”
            <br/> REPLY: "Contains the sequence number of the transaction and the merkle proof"
            <br/>
        </p>

        <h3>Read (Resolve)</h3>
        <p class="replace-me">A Sovrin DID records can be looked up directly by the DID using a standard Sovrin GET_NYM transaction that simply
            takes the DID and will return the DID record. The client trusts the DID record because it either receives the
            same DID record from sufficient number of validators or it receives a proof of the DID record from a single validator
            that the DID record is part of a merkle tree whose root has an aggregate signature from sufficient number of
            validators.
        </p>
        <p class="replace-me">This is how the DID record query looks like</p>
        <pre>
                {
                    idenifier: &lt;DID of the author of this query&gt;, 
                    signature: [&lt;signature over this transaction from the author&gt;,] 
                    reqId: &lt;a nonce for this query&gt;, 
                    operation: {type: GET_NYM, dest: &lt;DID whose record needs to be queried&gt;}
                }
        </pre>
        <p class="replace-me">Anyone can query a DID record, by sending the above request. The response contains the details of DID, it's role
            and verification key.
        </p>
        <pre>
                {
                    idenifier: &lt;DID of the author of this query&gt;, 
                    signature: [&lt;signature over this transaction from the author&gt;,] 
                    reqId: &lt;a nonce for this query&gt;, 
                    type: GET_NYM, 
                    dest: &lt;DID whose record needs to be queried&gt;,
                    verkey: &lt; verification key of the DID &gt;,
                    role: &lt; role, whether this DID is a Trust Anchor, a Steward, Trustee or is a non-priviledged identity &gt;,
                }
        </pre>

        <h3>Update</h3>
        <p class="replace-me">The DID method specification must specify how a owner or guardian of a DID can update the DID record on the target
            system, including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of control.</p>
        <p class="replace-me">To update the DID, the owner or guardian (guarianship ends once ownership begins) of the DID should send the following
            transaction
            <pre>
                        {
                            idenifier: &lt;DID of the owner or the guardian&gt;, 
                            signature: &lt;signature over this transaction from the DID in identifier&gt;, 
                            reqId: &lt;a nonce for this transaction&gt;, 
                            operation: {
                                type: NYM, 
                                dest: &lt;DID whose record is being updated&gt;, 
                                [verkey: &lt;new verification key of the DID&gt;],
                            }
                        }
                </pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Delete (Revoke)</h3>
        <p class="replace-me">The method spec MUST define how a DID can revoke it's verification key. Revocation is non-reversible--do not confuse
            it with key rotation. Although a core feature of distributed ledgers is immutability, a DID method must specify
            how a client can revoke a DID record on the target system, including all cryptographic operations necessary to
            establish proof of revocation. Revocation is the one way final operation for a DID. No use after revocation is
            an equivalent problem to the double-spend problem, which is what motivates the use of blockchains and other distributed
            ledger technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="replace-me">To revoke the key of the DID, the owner of the DID should send the following transaction
            <pre>
                        {
                            idenifier: &lt;DID of the owner&gt;, 
                            signature: &lt;signature over this transaction from the DID in identifier&gt;, 
                            reqId: &lt;a nonce for this transaction&gt;, 
                            operation: {
                                type: NYM, 
                                dest: &lt;DID whose key is being revoked&gt;, 
                                verkey: null,
                            }
                        }
                </pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
        <div class="replace-me">
            <h3>Attacks</h3>
            <p>At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered: eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion,
                modification, impersonation, and man-in-the-middle. Potential denial of service attacks MUST be identified
                as well. If the protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, it should be clearly indicated
                which portions of the data are protected and what the protections are (i.e., integrity only, confidentiality,
                and/or endpoint authentication, etc.). Some indication should also be given to what sorts of attacks the
                cryptographic protection is susceptible. Data which should be held secret (keying material, random seeds,
                etc.) should be clearly labeled. If the technology involves authentication, particularly user-host authentication,
                the security of the authentication method MUST be clearly specified.</p>

            <h3>Residual Risks</h3>
            <p>Discuss risks such as from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher) after threat
                mitigation has been deployed.

                <h3>Recovery From Key Compromise</h3>

                <p>This section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for all operations required by Section
                    7 of this specification (DID Operations).</p>
