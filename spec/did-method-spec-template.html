        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Sovrin DID method specification conforms to the requirements specified in the DID specification
           currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group. For more information about DIDs and
           DID method specifications, please see the <a
                    href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-primer.md"

      <p>
        Sovrin is a public ledger designed specifically and only for privacy-preserving
          self-sovereign identity. The Sovrin Ledger is governed by the
        international non-profit <a href="https://www.sovrin.org" target="_blank">Sovrin Foundation</a>.
        As the only public ledger designed exclusively for self-sovereign identity,
        Sovrin is optimized for DIDs and DID Documents. DIDs are created, stored,
        and used with verifiable claims. This specification covers how these DIDs are
        managed. It also describes related features of Sovrin of
        particular interest to DID owners, guardians, and developers.

        <h2>Sovrin DID Method </h2>
        <p>The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>sov</code></p>
        <p>A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:sov</code>.
            Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix,
            is the NSI specified below.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Target System(s)</h2>
        <p>This DID method applies to the Sovrin network in all its incarnations, beginning with Sovrin's
        provisional launch on 31 July 2017.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Namespace Specific Identifier (NSI)</h2>
        <p>
          The Sovrin DID scheme is defined by the following ABNF:<br><br>
          <code>
            sovrin-did = "did:sov:{idstring}"<br>
            idstring   = 22*23 char<br>
            char       = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" / "A" / "B" / "C"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "J" / "K" / "L" / "M" / "N" / "P" / "Q"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" / "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z" / "a" / "b" / "c"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" / "j" / "k" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" / "u" / "v" / "w" / "x" / "y" / "z"<br>
          </code><br>
          All Sovrin DIDs are <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding" target="_blank">base58Check encoding</a>s
          of a 16-byte uuid. The encoding uses most alphas and digits, omitting 0OIl to avoid readability problems. This
            gives an NSI length of either 22 or 23 characters, and it means that DIDs are case-sensitive and may not
            be case-normalized, even though the prefix is always lower-case.
          </p>
        <h3>Namestring Generation Method</h3>
        <p>The 16-byte uuid underlying a Sovrin DID can be generated in various ways--using standard uuid methods, for example, or
            by selecting the first 16 bytes of a 256 bit Ed25519 verification key (the public
          portion of the key pair). In the latter case, there may or may not be an active verification
          key for the identity owner; that information is only available in the
          key descriptions in the owner section of the DID Document.
        </p>
        <p>A convenient regex to match <code>sov</code> DIDs is: <br><br>
            <code>^[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{22,23}$</code></p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>A valid <code>sov</code> DID might be: <code>did:sov:2wJPyULfLLnYTEFYzByfUR</code>.</p>

      <h2>JSON-LD Context Definition</h2>
        <p>Sovrin Documents are stored on the ledger and use a small subset of valid document constructs from the spec.</p>
        <p>The official definition of the <code>htcr</code> JSON-LD context is:</p>
      <pre class="replace-me json" style="color:magenta">
      {
           "@context":
           {

        <h2>CRUD Operation Definitions</h2>

        <h3>Create (Register)</h3>
        <p>The DID method specification must specify how a client creates a DID record—the combination of a DID and its associated document—on the target system, including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of ownership.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>To create a DID, you must submit a transaction that looks like this: <br>
          <pre>

        <h3>Read (Resolve)</h3>
        <p>A Sovrin DID record can be looked up directly by the DID using a standard Sovrin GET_NYM transaction that simply
            takes the DID and will return the DID record. The client trusts the DID record because it either receives the
            same DID record from sufficient number of validators or it receives a proof of the DID record from a single validator
            that the DID record is part of a merkle tree whose root has an aggregate signature from sufficient number of
            validators.
        </p>
        <p>This is how the DID record query looks like</p>
        <pre>
                {
                    "identifier": &lt;DID of the author of this query&gt;,
                    "signature": &lt;signature over this transaction from the author&gt;,

                        "type": "GET_NYM",
                        "dest": &lt;DID whose record needs to be queried&gt;
                    }
                }
        </pre>
        <p>Anyone can query a DID record, by sending the above request. The response contains the details of DID, its role
            and verification key.

        <h3>Update (Replace)</h3>
        <p>To replace the DID document, the owner or guardian (guardianship ends once ownership begins) of the DID should send the following

        <h3>Delete (Revoke)</h3>
        <p>Deleting or revoking a verification key is not to be confused with temporary suspension or rotation. Deletion
            sets an identity's verification key to null; this permanently terminates the identity's ability to operate
            on the network because there is no key that the identity can use to authenticate itself--even to submit a
            new key rotation request. It is irreversible.</p>
         <p>Revocation may be appropriate
            when a person dies or a business is legally dissolved. It does not remove any record or history of the
            identity--it simply prevents any new history from accruing. This guarantees that
            no malicious actor can recover and reactivate an identity that's dead.</p>
        <p>The scope of deletion in Sovrin is one DID only. This does not prevent an entity from creating new DIDs;
        it simply prevents an entity from reusing the old DID that has been terminated.</p>
        <p> To revoke the document of the DID, the owner of
            the DID should send the following transaction.
            <pre>
                {
                    "identifier": &lt;DID of the owner&gt;,
                    "signature": &lt;signature over this transaction from the DID in identifier&gt;,
                    "reqId": &lt;a nonce for this transaction&gt;,
                    "operation": {
                        "type": "NYM",
                        "dest": &lt;DID whose key is being revoked&gt;,
                        "document": null
                    }
                }

        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
        <div class="replace-me">
        <h3>Attacks</h3>
            <p>At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered: eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, impersonation, and man-in-the-middle. Potential denial of service attacks MUST be identified as well. If the protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, it should be clearly indicated which portions of the data are protected and what the protections are (i.e., integrity only, confidentiality, and/or endpoint authentication, etc.). Some indication should also be given to what sorts of attacks the cryptographic protection is susceptible. Data which should be held secret (keying material, random seeds, etc.) should be clearly labeled. If the technology involves authentication, particularly user-host authentication, the security of the authentication method MUST be clearly specified.</p>

        <h3>Residual Risks</h3>
            <p>We don't believe to have any residual risks at this time.</p>

            <h3>Recovery From Key Compromise</h3>

            <p>This section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for all operations required by Section 7 of this specification (DID Operations).</p>

        constitute a canonical implementation of Sovrin DIDs, and should be treated like an oracle.
